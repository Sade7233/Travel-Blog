    <h2 id="WelcomeLine" >Welcome to Sade's Summit - my personal travel journal and resource guide. May it be the inspiration you've been waiting for to finally get your own wanderlusting on!</h2>

      <h3 class= "HomepageItem">Why Are We All Here?</h3>
        <p>The desire to travel has always lived within my spirit, but I didn’t grow up taking vacations with my family (trips to visit family members definitely don’t count!). I didn't take my first vacation until my senior year of college!</p>
        <img id="MrKrabs" class="HomepageItem" src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/gXhBZfzijya76/giphy.gif" alt="Mr. Krabs plays the world's saddest song on the world's smallest violin to highlight the petty injustice that was my under-traveled existence."class="center"/>
        <p>As I got older and my income became more steady, my list of travel destinations kept growing, but plans to vacation with my friends always fell through for one reason or another. Folks didn’t have their deposit money ready, they couldn't get the time off from work, et cetera. The explanations (read: <em>EXCUSES</em>) were endless. I eventually realized that if I kept waiting around for others to help my wanderlust dreams come true, it would never happen. And so Google and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/blog/category/travel-tips/">Trip Advisor</a> became my best friends. I researched, plotted like a maniac, and dove headfirst into solo travel early last year.</p>

      <h3 class="HomepageItem">What's So Great About (Solo) Travel, Anyway?</h3>
        <p>Travel can be whatever you want it to be. You can be taking a fight halfway across the world or taking a stroll through your own city - both are valid and both can be fulfilling. The most important aspect of travel is that you’re exploring your environment, learning about that space, and having fun in the process.</P>
          <p>Solo travel takes it up a notch, by encouraging you to travel all by yourself with the added perk of independence and freedom to do and see whatever you want, whenever you want.  It can be a little anxiety-inducing to think about at first, but it offers you the space and experiences for dramatic personal growth. Just think - if you can travel to another country solo, you can truly do ANYTHING!</p>
          <p>Disclaimer: I love my Me Time, but I want my blog to be a fun space for me to log ALL of my adventures - both solo AND group tings; both local and international - as well as all of the tips and tricks I've learned along the way.</P>
          <p>It's a love letter to the world, a tracker for myself, and a resource guide for all of you.</p>
        <h3 class="HomepageItem">Here's a cute lil timeline, mapping out where I've been so far:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>March 2016: New Orleans, Louisiana, USA</li>
            <li>August 2017: Denver, Colorado, USA</li>
            <li>March 2018: New York, New York, USA</li>
            <li>April 2018: Disney World - Orlando, Florida, USA</li>
            <li>August 2018: Punta Cana, Dominican Republic</li>
            <li>September 2018, November 2019, February 2020: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</li>
            <li>April 2019: Chicago, Illinois, USA</li>
            <li>May 2019: Montego Bay, Jamaica</li>
            <li>June 2019: Las Vegas, Nevada, USA</li>
            <li>January 2020: Valley Falls, New York, USA</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class="HomepageItem">What If I'm Not Ready to be Solo Dolo Yet?</h3>
          <p>That's totally okay! No pressure at all. That's what I'm here for! It took me some time to calm my anxities enough to click "book flight" for my first solo vacation to Chicago last Spring. And all of that was after much practice being solo-dolo in my own city - going to events and exploring my own backyard.</p>
          <p>It is my earnest hope that my triumphs will bring a twinkle to your eye and that the fact that I've lived to tell these tales will soothe your own anxieties enough to help you step out of your comfort zone. If I can do it, so can you!</p>
        <h3 class="HomepageItem">And If I AM Ready?...0,0 </h3>
          <p>Then let's GOOO!! I hope you can use my experiences as a jumping off point to help plan your own trips. Check out my vacation planning app here! (available soon on iOS)</p>
